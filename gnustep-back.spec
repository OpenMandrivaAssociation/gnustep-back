%description
It is a library of graphical user interface classes written
completely in the Objective-C language; the classes are based
upon the OpenStep specification as released by NeXT Software, Inc.
The library does not completely conform to the specification 
and has been enhanced in a number of ways to take advantage
of the GNU system. These classes include graphical objects
such as buttons, text fields, popup lists, browser lists,
and windows; there are also many associated classes
for handling events, colors, fonts, pasteboards and images.
